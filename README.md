In fiancial worlds, people are not only interested in finding out the rate of return of a stock. Moreover, investors can reduce investment risks through diversification, and portfolio risk can be reduced by holding instruments that are not perfectly correlated. Therefore, in project 2, I'm trying to calculate the correlation coefficient between 2 stocks to provide insights into their return movements over time.
